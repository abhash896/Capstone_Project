This work is a case study on the analysis of a fictional company named "Cyclistic bike-share". This case study is about understanding the usage behavior of casual riders and annual members for cyclistic bikes and how they differ from each other. The insights from this analysis can be utilized to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members as the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.

The dataset used in this case study has a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the dataset is appropriate. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc.
